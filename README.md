   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   For development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### Frontend Setup

   ```

4. Run the Flutter app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## API Endpoints

### POST /analyze
Analyzes uploaded images based on filename.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "filename": "diseased_leaf.jpg"
}
```

**Response Examples:**
- **Crop Disease**: `diseased_leaf.jpg`
- **Soil Analysis**: `soil_sample.jpg`  
- **Weather**: `cloudy_sky.jpg`

### POST /chatbot
Processes chat queries and returns appropriate responses.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "query": "मौसम कैसा रहेगा?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "अगले 2 दिनों में हल्की बारिश की संभावना है।"
}
```

## Mock Data

### Analysis Responses
The backend provides mock responses for specific filenames:
- `diseased_leaf.jpg` → Crop disease analysis
- `soil_sample.jpg` → Soil health assessment
- `cloudy_sky.jpg` → Weather prediction

### Chatbot Keywords
The chatbot responds to these Hindi/English keywords:
- Weather: `weather`, `मौसम`
- Prices: `price`, `मंडी`, `भाव`
- Schemes: `scheme`, `योजना`
- Fertilizer: `fertilizer`, `खाद`, `उर्वरक`
- Disease: `disease`, `रोग`, `बीमारी`
- Irrigation: `irrigation`, `सिंचाई`, `पानी`

### Mandi Prices
Hardcoded price data for:
- **Wheat**: ₹2150-2200/quintal
- **Rice**: ₹3150-3200/quintal  
- **Tomato**: ₹1450-1600/quintal

## Development Notes

### For Production Deployment
1. **Replace Mock APIs**: Integrate real APIs like:
   - Gemini Vision API for image analysis
   - OpenWeatherMap for weather data
   - eNAM/AgMarkNet for mandi prices

2. **Add Authentication**: Implement Firebase Auth or similar

3. **Database Integration**: Use Firebase Firestore or similar

4. **Real-time Features**: Add WebSocket support for live updates

5. **Offline Support**: Implement local caching with TensorFlow Lite

### Testing
- Test image analysis with different filenames
- Try various chatbot queries in Hindi and English
- Verify mandi price display for all crops
